## Difficulties/Unsolved Problems
- Had problems with adapting a gif into animated sprites for the player character.
- Was unable to make sure the restart button appears on the subheader while gameplay is active only without breaking the game due to time constraint 

## Future Development

- Set a timer based win condition to allow for saving high scores to compete against
- Save scores in a database and display High Scores that reset after a set timeframe like a day, week, or month
- Add more specicial effects like moving stars in the background and small animations when theres a collision detected or win/lose condition 
- Add more levels and game modes with varying difficulty 
- Dynamic movement for player that is compatible with mobile experience, hover mouse or finger to move player all around with clicking or tap to shoot
